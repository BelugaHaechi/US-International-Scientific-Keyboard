<p>This keyboard layout is easy to install, easy to use, and easy to memorize, while having extensive capabilities covering common Latin letters, diacritics, mathematical symbols, additional punctuation, and some mathematical font letters. It is recommended for those who often work in <strong>STEM</strong> fields on a <strong>Windows</strong> system, and have collaborations with co-workers from <strong>diverse language backgrounds</strong>. It is also intended as a better alternative to the United States-International keyboard layout that had dead keys inconveniently bound on commonly used keys.</p>

<p>This keyboard layout was created using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 (MSKLC 1.4). The layout is based on the common <strong>English (United States) QWERTY keyboard layout</strong>, and some designs are consistent with the <em>United States-International keyboard layout</em>. Other ideas were inspired by and improved on the basis of <a href="https://michaelgoerz.net/notes/the-us-international-scientific-keyboard-layout/index.html">Michael Goerz's version</a> of the &quot;U.S. International - Scientific&quot; keyboard layout for Mac systems.</p>
<p>A detailed comparison chart of this keyboard layout with other layouts can be found in <a href="#comparison-to-other-layouts">this section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start-guide">Quick Start Guide</h2>
<p>Setting up this keyboard on your computer is very simple!</p>
<ol>
<li>(<em>Optional</em>) Be logged in to an Administrator account on your computer. Configuring the keyboard will require Administrator permission.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/BelugaHaechi/US-International-Scientific-Keyboard/releases/latest">the latest release</a> to any directory on your computer.
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Releases are named as <code>KBDUSS</code> + major version number + minor version letter. We will use <code>KBDUSS**</code> to represent this below. This naming system is in conformity with system files in <code>C:\Windows\System32\KBD*.dll</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Open the folder, and run the program <code>setup.exe</code> in the folder. Do not alter or delete any other files in the folder.</li>
<li>Follow the setup instructions that will pop up. At some point, you will be asked for Administrator permission; please allow to continue.</li>
<li>Now the keyboard is installed on your computer! The last step is to enable the layout in Settings.
<ul>
<li>Open Settings on your computer.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>Time &amp; language &gt; Language &amp; region &gt; Keyboards</code> (this may differ slightly for various Windows versions).</li>
<li>Select <code>Add a keyboard</code>, and select <code>US-International and Scientific keyboard</code> in the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>(<em>Optional</em>) You can now disable the original <code>US keyboard (QWERTY)</code>, since its functions could be completely replaced by the new keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Congratulations! You are now all set to use the US International Scientific keyboard on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You may wish to retain the <code>KBDUSS**</code> folder, because it could be used to repair/uninstall the keyboard layout on your computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="update--uninstallation-guide">Update / Uninstallation Guide</h2>
<p>Uninstallation of the keyboard layout is also simple. You may wish to do so, if:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a new version of the keyboard available, and you will need to uninstall the previous version before installing the new one. Yes, minor improvements may be made to the layout upon request, feel free to post your ideas in Issues.</li>
<li>The keyboard layout doesn't work as intended on your device. If so, you may wish to reinstall the layout.</li>
<li>You wish to discard the layout for any reason :( Sad, but you are free to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>To uninstall the keyboard layout, simply revisit the <code>KBDUSS**</code> folder, and run <code>setup.exe</code> again. This time you would be prompted to repair or uninstall the keyboard layout, and select the action as you wish. Administrator permission may be required again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Known issue:</strong> Possibly due to a Windows system bug, on uninstallation the keyboard layout will not be compeletely removed. Don't worry – this does not affect normal usage of other keyboard layouts. You may be still able to find the name of the layout in the keyboard layout list in computer settings, but if you try to add this layout to your input methods, it cannot appear in the input methods list for actual use. In other words, only a &quot;ghost&quot; placeholder of the layout will remain in the list. In the system files the keyboard layout's <code>.dll</code> configuration is deleted, but it is still registered somewhere as a blank case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="must-know-concepts">Must-know Concepts</h2>
<p>The US International Scientific keyboard layout utilizes two important concepts to achieve its unparalleled functionality: <strong>dead keys</strong> and the <strong>AltGr shift state</strong>. These concepts, common in non-English keyboard layouts, are explained below for those unfamiliar with them.</p>
<h3 id="dead-keys">Dead keys</h3>
<p>When a normal key is pressed, a character is returned. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key"><strong>dead keys</strong></a> do not return a character when initially pressed, but rather waits for the next keypress and uses this input to determine the character it should return. This essentially enables a key to be mapped to multiple characters, for example key <code>`</code> (backtick) could be mapped to all characters with an acute accent: à, ù, ì, À, Ù, Ì, and so on.</p>
<p>This comes at the cost of requiring two keypresses to access one character, as in the example to type <code>à</code> one would need to press <code>`</code> then <code>a</code>. The character <code>`</code> is called the <strong>base character</strong> of the dead key in this case. If the second keypress does not map to a character in the dead key's character set, the base character of the dead key is returned along with the second character.</p>
<p>By convention, the set of characters mapped to a dead key should share similar features, and also with the base character. It is also conventional to always have the <em>space key</em> mapped to the <strong>default case</strong> of a dead key, usually a blank version of the base character. Dead keys are used extensively in many modern keyboard layouts, such as in the Greek Polytonic layout, the US-International layout, the UK Extended layout, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="shift-states-and-altgr">Shift states and AltGr</h3>
<p><strong>Shift state</strong> is a term for the layers of a keyboard layout, that could be interchanged by the state of control keys (<code>Shift</code>, <code>Alt</code>, <code>Ctrl</code>). We normally use two shift states: the blank shift state, and the <code>Shift</code> shift state. In fact, there are extra shift states arising from the combinations of the 3 control keys. Among the most well known are the <code>Alt</code> + <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>Alt</code> + <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> shift states, commonly referred to as the <strong>AltGr shift states</strong> because they are accessed by holding the <code>AltGr</code> (short for Alternative Graphics) key on European keyboards. On keyboards without <code>AltGr</code>, hold the <strong>Right <code>Alt</code> key</strong> to access these shift states; holding down both <code>Alt</code> and <code>Ctrl</code> keys is also valid. <code>AltGr</code> expands a keyboard layout to twice the original size, enabling the addition of new functions.</p>
<p>Shift states with only <code>Alt</code> or <code>Ctrl</code> are mostly unused in keyboard layouts, because these key combinations are reserved for hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts).</p>
<p>In the US International Scientific keyboard layout, the key mappings in the normal shift states are identical to that in the common English (United States) QWERTY keyboard layout. Thus, without <code>AltGr</code>, it is just a normal layout; this feature is intended to make the transition to this layout extremely easy. All extra functionalities are carefully designed into the AltGr shift states, along with usage of dead keys.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-key-mappings">Overview of Key Mappings</h2>
<p>Below is a figure of the US International Scientific keyboard layout, made by <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/">this tool</a> (also <a href="https://github.com/ijprest/keyboard-layout-editor">on Github</a>). This figure may be greatly helpful as a reference to the functionalities of this keyboard layout.</p>
<p><strong>Legend</strong></p>
<p>⚫ <em>Black:</em> Normal keys. When pressed, returns the character shown.</p>
<p>🔴 <em>Red:</em> Dead keys. When pressed, waits for a second keypress, then returns a character based on the second keypress.</p>
<p>🟣 <em>Purple:</em> Dead keys, but due to restraints its base character does not well represent the set of characters mapped to the dead key. The former character in this representation is the base, the latter is the default case.</p>
<p>🟥 <em>Red keycaps:</em> At least one of the key's shift states is set as a dead key.</p>
<p>🟦 <em>Blue keycaps:</em> The key is used to control the shift states relevant to this layout.</p>

<h2 id="core-design-ideas">Core Design Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Complete compatibility with plain keyboards.</strong> <em>The US QWERTY keyboard layout remains unchanged</em>, and all extensions are &quot;hidden&quot; in the <code>AltGr</code> (<code>Alt</code> + <code>Ctrl</code>) and <code>AltGr</code> + <code>Shift</code> (<code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>Shift</code>) shift states. Therefore it will be just an ordinary layout under normal use, and fits with its positioning as a &quot;keyboard extension&quot;.<br>
Also, key mappings from the original United States-International keyboard are retained whenever appropriate, so that it aligns with Microsoft design and users switching over will find it more familiar to work with. These mappings with be denoted with a <code>(USX)</code> mark, referencing the Windows <code>KBDUSX.dll</code> file containing setup information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistent logicality of key mappings.</strong> Every key mapping should always <em>make as much sense as possible</em> and provide convenience for both multilingual and mathematical input. Every reason for a certain mapping should be explicitly documented, and alternatives should be discussed if any.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one among name, shape, usage, etc. of the character allocated should be related with the key that it is mapped to.</li>
<li>Common characters should be easy to access, while uncommon characters should be set further out of reach, and rare and awkward characters should be avoided.</li>
<li>Characters of the same type should have similar shift states, when possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compact organization by using dead keys.</strong> Multiple characters that share an obvious characteristic (best shown in its Unicode naming or block) should be considered to be included in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key">dead key</a>. Dead keys will be highlighted with a bold notice &quot;<strong>Dead key.</strong>&quot;, and the mappings should be fully provided for reference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dead key base characters should be chosen with the same criteria as normal characters.</li>
<li>If the common characteristic is a diacritic, the base assignment should be the combining diacritic for versatility. If it is not, it should be meaningful as a fallback, or another related character (this is the hard part!).</li>
<li>In dead key mappings, the final base character should be a space (U+0020) that maps to: 1) if diacritic, the diacritic itself alone (modifier letter); 2) if else, the most common character among all options.</li>
<li>The dead key should provide access to this class of characters to the maximum extent, except for those that are rarely used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maximum flexibility under system restraints.</strong> Due to the restrictions imposed explicitly and implicitly, by MSKLC 1.4, Microsoft frameworks, and related bugs, the scope of design and functionality of this keyboard layout is somewhat restricted. However, under these restrictions, the design will strive to include the most functionality possible without causing compatibility issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematical Greek letters are fully supported as in §2.2 of <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/">Unicode® Technical Report #25: Unicode Support For Mathematics</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The range of Unicode characters included is limited. All output only include one character or code point. All output characters are within the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of Unicode (U+0000..U+FFFF). All dead key base assignments are within U+0000..U+0FFF.</strong> Currently most characters are within U+0000..U+2FFF.</li>
<li>Customization is not imposed on control keys, numpad, arrow keys, and function keys.</li>
<li>Dead keys are not chained, and all base characters are available in the normal and <code>Shift</code> shift states.</li>
<li>Shift states only include normal, <code>Shift</code>, <code>AltGr</code> (<code>Ctrl+Alt</code>), and <code>Shift+AltGr</code> (<code>Ctrl+Alt+Shift</code>). Excluded states include <code>Ctrl</code>, <code>Ctrl+Shift</code>, <code>SGCaps</code> (<code>CapsLock</code>), and so on.</li>
</ul>

<li>There exists U+2057 QUADRUPLE PRIME and U+221C FOURTH ROOT as candidates for key <code>4</code>, but they were not chosen because 1) these characters are rarely used (we live in a 3-dimensional world), and 2) there exists reasonable USX layout options to retain (which were used in this layout).</li>
<li>The superscripts and subscripts provided are limited intentionally by Unicode, in a way that not every letter in the alphabet has one. Most of these mini letters were coded in the first place for IPA phonetics! It is suggested to always use rich text to achieve such styles for normal text, and this keyboard layout provides these choices only to aid in plain text communication.</li>
<li>For keys <code>=</code> and <code>+</code>, for the pair of characters U+00BA MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR and U+00AA FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR, the decision to map the former to the shifted shift state was based on the fact that masculinity is usually associated with outgoing character. Here no bias on gender and sex is intended; this was solely based on general social observation, which is subject to change as society progresses. It is thoroughly acknowledged that females could express masculinity and vice versa, and there are other gender identities apart from the binary system.</li>

<h2 id="notes-on-msklc-14">Notes on MSKLC 1.4</h2>
<p>This project is made possible by the software <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134">Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator</a>. Sadly, several bugs or limitations exist in this software that had prevented this project from being more powerful and extensive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Errors when renaming layouts. In certain cases (details unclear), editing the layout description text on a custom version of an imported layout will not take effect. Sometimes there is a newline between the DESCRIPTION section and the LANGUAGE section, and sometimes not, which may affect the behavior of descriptions.</li>
<li>Dead key base limit at U+0FFF. Dead keys that have a base of greater than U+1000 will not work when the <code>.dll</code> is created. When triggered, the Windows system gives off an alarm noise, instead of no response for an undefined key combination. When the built custom keyboard layout is then loaded into MSKLC, the deadkeys are blank and no codepoint designation can be seen.
<ul>
<li>Tested base codepoints: mutiple codepoints greater than U+2100 (in the math symbols section), U+2000, U+1ffd, U+1800, U+1000, [U+0fda, U+0f00, U+0e01, U+0a01, U+0800, U+0308] (in brackets = success)</li>
<li>The original author seemed to be aware of this problem since 2008, but it is still not resolved. This is probably due to an internal Microsoft restriction :/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Character limit at U+FFFF. For normal keys, there is also an upper limit restriction found at roughly U+10000, which means that only the codepoints in the BMP (U+0000..U+FFFF) can be accessed. The behavior of this issue is the same for dead keys.
<ul>
<li>For example, an attempt to include U+1D7D9 failed.</li>
<li>This prevents inclusion of most letters with mathematical fonts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, these issues have no hope of being fixed in the short term, since the software is not completely open-source, and its original creator has passed away…</p>
<p>R.I.P Michael Scott Kaplan (*1970/02/27 Creve Coeur — †2015/10/21 Redmond), Microsoft developer and the very creator of MSKLC. He passed away at age 45 from multiple sclerosis, a disease he fought against for 25 years. He was a very talented and responsible person, with good humor and writing… He had a colorful life: conflicts with Microsoft, battles with fatal diseases, affairs with prostitutes, and fun blogs that were brought to the readers by a unique Unicode character.</p>
